# HatchDev Task 1

Welcome to **HatchDev Task 1**, part of the HatchDev bootcamp â€” a free program that helps students who have learned HTML, CSS, and JavaScript level up into world-class software engineers. This task focuses on foundational object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts using **TypeScript**.

## ðŸ“˜ Task Overview

This repository contains two core OOP projects implemented in TypeScript:

### 1. Library Management System

A simple system to manage books and members of a library using object-oriented principles such as:

- **Abstraction**
- **Encapsulation**
- **Inheritance**
- **Polymorphism**

### 2. Simple Task Manager

A command-line task manager to:

- Create tasks
- Update tasks
- Mark tasks as completed
- List all tasks

## ðŸ§° Tech Stack

- **TypeScript** (No additional dependencies or frameworks)

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)

### Setup

1. **Clone the repository:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/hatchdev-task-1.git
cd hatchdev-task-1
```

2. **Install TypeScript globally (if not already installed):**

```bash
npm install -g typescript
```

3. **Compile the TypeScript files:**
```bash
tsc --watch
```

4. **Run the compiled JavaScript files with Node:**
   Navigate to the the task folder you want to see the result of
```
node dist/index.js
```

## ðŸ§  OOP Concepts Applied
- Abstraction: Hiding complex logic behind class methods.
- Encapsulation: Managing internal states with private/protected members.
- Inheritance: Sharing behavior across related classes.
- Polymorphism: Allowing different implementations through a common interface.
